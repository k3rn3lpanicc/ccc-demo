# Private Market Prediction System

A privacy-preserving betting system that uses threshold encryption and mock Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to enable confidential voting and transparent settlement on Ethereum.

## What is This?

This is a proof-of-concept betting platform where:

- **Users vote privately** on options A or B with ETH stakes via a web interface
- **Individual votes remain encrypted** throughout the voting period
- **Vote distribution is revealed periodically** (every 5 votes) to prevent identification
- **Two metrics tracked**: A-ratio (vote count) and A-funds-ratio (funds amount)
- **Real-time visualization** shows both metrics on an interactive chart
- **TEE processes all votes** in a confidential manner
- **Smart contract holds funds** and enforces settlement rules
- **Winners are paid proportionally** to their stakes
- **Automated voting** script available for testing with multiple accounts

## Cryptographic Scheme

### Architecture Overview

```
User Vote → Smart Contract → Event Listener → Nodes (Threshold Re-encryption)
                ↓                                      ↓
         Encrypted State                    TEE (Decrypt & Process)
                ↓                                      ↓
         Blockchain Storage ←─────── New Encrypted State
```

### Key Components

1. **Umbral Threshold Encryption**
   - Based on proxy re-encryption
   - 7 nodes, 4-of-7 threshold (Byzantine fault tolerant)
   - Prevents single point of compromise

2. **TEE (Mock)**
   - **Note**: Due to lack of access to hardware TEE (Intel SGX, AMD SEV), this is implemented as a Python FastAPI service
   - In production, this would run in a hardware-isolated enclave
   - Holds the only private key that can decrypt votes
   - Processes votes and updates encrypted state

3. **Forward Secrecy**
   - Each state update uses a new symmetric key
   - Old keys are discarded immediately
   - Past states cannot be decrypted even if TEE is compromised later

4. **Smart Contract**
   - Holds encrypted state on-chain
   - Manages ETH deposits and payouts
   - Enforces admin controls for finishing and settlement

### Encryption Flow

#### Vote Submission

```
1. User creates vote: {address, bet_amount, bet_on: "A"/"B"}
2. Generate random symmetric key (AES-256)
3. Encrypt vote with AES-GCM
4. Encrypt symmetric key with master public key (Umbral)
5. Submit to smart contract with ETH stake
```

#### Vote Processing

```
1. Contract emits VoteSubmitted event
2. Listener detects event
3. Listener forwards vote to ONE node (e.g., node at port 5000)
4. That node collects cfrags from all other nodes (calls all 7 nodes)
5. Nodes re-encrypt using their kfrags (key fragments)
6. The coordinating node forwards vote + collected cfrags to TEE
7. TEE performs threshold decryption (needs 4+ cfrags)
8. TEE decrypts symmetric key
9. TEE decrypts vote with symmetric key
10. TEE updates state (adds vote, recalculates a_ratio)
11. TEE generates NEW symmetric key
12. TEE encrypts new state with new key
13. TEE encrypts new key with its own public key
14. TEE returns new encrypted state to node
15. Node returns result to listener
16. Listener updates contract with new encrypted state
```

#### Privacy Protection

- **A-ratio** (percentage voting for A) is only revealed when `total_votes % 5 == 0`
- **A-funds-ratio** (percentage of funds on A) is also revealed at the same intervals
- This prevents identifying individual votes from ratio changes
- Provides batch transparency while maintaining voter privacy
- Historical data is tracked and visualized in real-time chart

#### Settlement

```
1. Admin calls finishBetting() → no more votes accepted
2. Admin calls TEE /finish endpoint with winning option
3. TEE decrypts final state
4. TEE calculates proportional payouts:
   winner_payout = (winner_stake / total_winner_stakes) × total_pool
5. Admin calls setPayouts() with calculated amounts
6. Winners call claimPayout() to withdraw their ETH
```

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements

- **Python 3.12+** with pip
- **Node.js 16+** with npm
- **Git**

### Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn web3 cryptography umbral-pre requests
```

### Node.js Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 🚀 Setup and Usage

### Step 1: Start the TEE

```bash
python -m uvicorn tee:app
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Generated new TEE secret key
TEE Public Key: AzXtAf1xt7gAv8IMcXHWjkUYt0M8SfNrqD7ykWu5HWpg
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Copy the TEE Public Key for the next step.

**About the TEE:**

- This is a **mock TEE** implemented as a simple FastAPI service
- In production, this would run in a hardware-isolated Trusted Execution Environment (Intel SGX, AMD SEV, ARM TrustZone)
- The TEE generates a random secret key on startup
- This key is used to decrypt the final encrypted state containing votes

### Step 2: Generate Master Keys and Key Fragments

```bash
cd kd
python kd.py
```

**Prompts:**

```
Enter TEE public key (Bob's public key): <paste the key from Step 1>
```

**What this does:**

- Generates a **master key pair** for encrypting votes
- Creates an **authority key pair** for generating kfrags
- Splits the decryption capability into **7 kfrags** (key fragments)
- Sets **threshold = 4** (need 4 out of 7 nodes)
- Saves everything to `kd/umbral_state.json`

**Output:**

```json
{
  "master_public_key": "...",
  "authority_public_key": "...",
  "tee_public_key": "...",  // TEE public key
  "kfrags": [...],  // 7 key fragments
  "threshold": 4,
  "shares": 7
}
```

### Step 3: Start the Threshold Nodes

```bash
cd ../nodes
python run_nodes.py
```

**What this does:**

- Starts 7 Flask servers on ports 5000-5006
- Each node receives one kfrag (key fragment)
- **Randomly marks 2 nodes as corrupt/malicious**
- Nodes provide re-encryption services

**Expected Output:**

```
Starting 7 Umbral nodes...
Node 0 running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 [Honest]
Node 1 running on http://127.0.0.1:5001 [Honest]
Node 2 running on http://127.0.0.1:5002 [CORRUPT]
Node 3 running on http://127.0.0.1:5003 [Honest]
Node 4 running on http://127.0.0.1:5004 [Honest]
Node 5 running on http://127.0.0.1:5005 [Honest]
Node 6 running on http://127.0.0.1:5006 [CORRUPT]

Threshold system active: Need 4+ cfrags to decrypt
Corrupt nodes may refuse to cooperate, but system remains secure!
```

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance:**

- System works even if 3 nodes are down/corrupt
- Only need 4 honest nodes out of 7

### Step 4: Start Local Ethereum Network

```bash
cd ..
npm run node
```

**What this does:**

- Starts Hardhat local Ethereum network
- Provides 20 test accounts with 10,000 ETH each
- Network runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8545`

**Keep this terminal running.**

### Step 5: Deploy Smart Contract

**New terminal:**

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-with-tee.js --network localhost
```

**What this does:**

1. Calls TEE's `/initialize_state` endpoint
2. Gets empty encrypted state
3. Deploys `PrivateBetting.sol` contract
4. Initializes contract with encrypted state
5. Saves contract address to `contract-address.json`

**Expected Output:**

```
Deploying PrivateBetting contract with TEE initialization...

📡 Requesting initial state from TEE...
✅ Received encrypted state from TEE
   State length: 228 chars

📝 Deploying contract...
✅ PrivateBetting deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
   Admin address: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266

✅ Contract address saved to contract-address.json
```

### Step 6: Start Event Listener

**New terminal:**

```bash
python contract_listener.py
```

**What this does:**

- Connects to local Ethereum network
- Listens for `VoteSubmitted` events from the contract
- When a vote is detected:
  1. Calls one node (port 5000) with the encrypted vote
  2. Node handles everything:
     - Collects cfrags from all 7 nodes (including itself)
     - Forwards vote + cfrags to TEE
     - TEE decrypts and processes vote
     - Returns new encrypted state
  3. Listener receives result and updates contract state
- Displays a_ratio and a_funds_ratio when `total_votes % 5 == 0` (if revealed by TEE)
- **Tracks history** and saves to `a_ratio_history.json` for frontend visualization

**Expected Output:**

```
============================================================

   Starting from current block: 5
```

**Keep this terminal running.**

### Step 7: Start Frontend API

**New terminal:**

```bash
python frontend_api.py
```

**What this does:**

- Starts FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:3001`
- Provides REST API for the web frontend
- Handles vote submission with automatic encryption
- Manages finish/distribute workflow with batching for large voter counts
- Supports up to 50 accounts from Hardhat

**Keep this terminal running.**

### Step 8: Start Web Frontend

**New terminal:**

```bash
cd front-end
npm install  # First time only
npm run dev
```

**Access the frontend:**

Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

**Features:**

- **Dark theme** with teal blue accents
- **Real-time chart** showing A-ratio and A-funds-ratio over time
- **Vote submission** using dropdown of Hardhat accounts (no wallet needed)
- **Contract status** display
- **Finish prediction** button for admin

### Step 9: Submit Votes (Web UI or Script)

#### Option A: Use Web Interface (Recommended)

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Select an account from the dropdown
3. Enter bet amount (e.g., 0.1 ETH)
4. Choose Option A or B
5. Click "Submit Vote"
6. Watch the chart update every 5 votes!

#### Option B: Use Python Script

**New terminal:**

```bash
python submit_vote_to_contract.py
```

**Interactive prompts:**

```
Available accounts:
  1. 0x70997970...dc79C8 (10000.00 ETH)
  2. 0x3C44CdDd...07eAeE (10000.00 ETH)
  3. 0x90F79bf6...93b906 (10000.00 ETH)
  ...

Select account (1-5): 1

Bet amount in ETH (e.g., 0.1): 0.1
Bet on (A/B): A

📝 Creating vote: 0.1 ETH on A
✅ Vote encrypted

📤 Submitting to contract with 0.1 ETH...
   Transaction sent: 0x123abc...
   Waiting for confirmation...
✅ Vote submitted successfully!
   Block: 6
   Gas used: 127463

👂 The contract listener should now detect and process this vote!
```

**What happens:**

1. Vote is encrypted with AES-GCM using random symmetric key
2. Symmetric key is encrypted with master public key (Umbral)
3. Transaction sent to contract with 0.1 ETH
4. Contract emits `VoteSubmitted` event
5. **Listener processes automatically** (check listener terminal)

**Listener output:**

```
============================================================
📥 New Vote Event Detected!
============================================================
Voter: 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
Amount: 0.1 ETH
Block: 6

📤 Submitting to node for processing...
  (Node will collect cfrags from all nodes and forward to TEE)
✅ Vote processed successfully!
Vote info: {'bet_amount': 100000000000000000, 'bet_on': 'A'}
Total votes: 1
🔒 A-ratio hidden for privacy (revealed every 5 votes)

📝 Updating contract state...
✅ State updated in contract (tx: 0x456def...)
============================================================
```

**Privacy Feature:**

- Votes 1-4: A-ratio hidden
- Vote 5: A-ratio revealed (e.g., 60.00%)
- Votes 6-9: Hidden again
- Vote 10: Revealed (e.g., 55.00%)

**Submit multiple votes:**

```bash
# Run multiple times with different accounts
python submit_vote_to_contract.py  # Account 2, 0.2 ETH, B
python submit_vote_to_contract.py  # Account 3, 0.15 ETH, A
python submit_vote_to_contract.py  # Account 4, 0.3 ETH, B
python submit_vote_to_contract.py  # Account 5, 0.05 ETH, A
```

**After 5th vote:**

```
📊 A-ratio revealed: 60.00%
💰 A-funds-ratio revealed: 45.00%
```

### Step 10: Automated Voting (Optional - For Testing)

**For quickly testing with many votes:**

```bash
python auto_vote.py
```

**What this does:**

- Automatically votes from accounts 10-49 (40 accounts)
- Random amounts between 0.1-10 ETH
- Strategic distribution:
  - 65% vote for A (but with smaller bets)
  - 35% vote for B (but with larger bets)
  - Creates interesting divergence between vote ratio and funds ratio!
- 2 second delay between votes
- Shows statistics at the end

**Configuration** (edit `auto_vote.py`):

```python
START_ACCOUNT = 10
END_ACCOUNT = 49
A_VOTE_PROBABILITY = 0.65  # 65% vote A
A_HIGH_BET_PROBABILITY = 0.3  # 30% of A voters bet high
B_HIGH_BET_PROBABILITY = 0.7  # 70% of B voters bet high
```

### Step 11: Finish Betting and Calculate Payouts

#### Option A: Use Web Interface (Recommended)

1. Click the "🏁 Finish Prediction" button in the web UI
2. Select the winning option (A or B)
3. Click "Confirm & Distribute"
4. Wait for all 3 steps to complete:
   - Finish betting
   - Calculate payouts (via TEE)
   - Set payouts in contract (with automatic batching)

**Note:** With many voters (50+), payouts are automatically batched in groups of 50 to avoid gas limits.

#### Option B: Use Python Script

```bash
python finish_and_distribute.py
```

**Interactive flow:**

```

============================================================
STEP 3: SET PAYOUTS IN CONTRACT
============================================================

Set payouts in contract? (y/n): y

📝 Setting payouts for 90 wallets...
   Using 2 batch(es) of up to 50 addresses each

   Batch 1/2: Setting 50 payouts...

============================================================
✅ PROCESS COMPLETE!
============================================================

Winners can now claim their payouts by calling:
  contract.claimPayout()

Or use the claim script:
  python claim_payout.py

Contract balance: 0.75 ETH
```

**Payout Calculation:**

- Winners split the total pool proportionally to their stakes
- Formula: `payout = (your_stake / total_winner_stakes) × total_pool`
- Losers get 0

**Example:**

```
Total pool: 0.75 ETH
Winners (voted A):
  - Account 1: 0.1 ETH stake
  - Account 3: 0.2 ETH stake
  - Account 5: 0.15 ETH stake
  Total winner stakes: 0.45 ETH

Payouts:
  - Account 1: (0.1/0.45) × 0.75 = 0.1666 ETH
  - Account 3: (0.2/0.45) × 0.75 = 0.3333 ETH
  - Account 5: (0.15/0.45) × 0.75 = 0.25 ETH
```

### Step 12: Claim Winnings

## New Features

### Web Frontend

- **Dark theme** with teal blue and cyan accents
- **Dual-metric visualization**: A-ratio (vote %) and A-funds-ratio (funds %)
- **Real-time chart** with Chart.js showing historical trends
- **Account dropdown** supporting up to 50 Hardhat accounts
- **Admin controls** for finishing predictions and distributing payouts
- **Responsive design** with full-width chart display

### Performance Optimizations

- **Batched payouts**: Automatically splits large payout arrays into 50-address batches
- **Gas optimization**: Each batch uses 10M gas limit
- **Handles unlimited voters**: No more "out of gas" errors with many participants
- **Smart chart updates**: Only redraws when data changes (no flickering)

### Testing Tools

- **auto_vote.py**: Automated voting with strategic distribution
  - Configurable vote bias (default: 65% vote A, 35% vote B)
  - Different betting strategies (A voters bet small, B voters bet large)
  - Creates interesting divergence between the two metrics
  - Adjustable parameters for custom scenarios

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (Development)

- ✅ Threshold encryption protects against node compromise
- ✅ Forward secrecy prevents historical decryption
- ✅ Byzantine fault tolerance (handles 3 corrupt nodes)
- ✅ Smart contract enforces rules and holds funds
- ✅ Batched payouts prevent gas limit issues
- ⚠️  TEE is mocked (no hardware isolation)
- ⚠️  No signature verification on TEE responses
- ⚠️  Anyone can call `updateState()` (should be oracle-only)
- ⚠️  Local development network (no real stakes)
- ⚠️  Frontend uses predefined accounts (no wallet integration)

### Production Requirements

1. **Hardware TEE**
   - Intel SGX, AMD SEV, or ARM TrustZone
   - Remote attestation for verification
   - Sealed storage for keys

2. **Oracle Authorization**
   - Restrict `updateState()` to authorized oracles
   - Multi-signature for admin functions
   - Time locks for critical operations

3. **Economic Security**
   - Node operator bonds
   - Slashing for misbehavior
   - Reward mechanisms for honest operation

4. **Network Deployment**
   - Deploy on testnet (Sepolia, Goerli)
   - Then mainnet with audits
   - Distributed node operators

5. **Additional Features**
   - Time-based betting windows
   - Minimum/maximum bet limits
   - Emergency pause mechanism
   - Upgrade mechanisms

## Quick Start (All-in-One)

For the complete setup with web frontend:

1. **Terminal 1**: `python -m uvicorn tee:app`
2. **Terminal 2**: `cd kd && python kd.py` (paste TEE key, then exit)
3. **Terminal 3**: `cd nodes && python run_nodes.py`
4. **Terminal 4**: `npm run node`
5. **Terminal 5**: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-with-tee.js --network localhost`

```

### What to Expect

- ✅ Votes submitted via web UI or CLI
- ✅ Listener processes votes automatically
- ✅ A-ratio and A-funds-ratio revealed every 5 votes
- ✅ Real-time chart updates showing both metrics
- ✅ Divergence between vote count and funds (with auto_vote.py)
- ✅ Corrupt nodes don't break the system
- ✅ Automatic batching handles 100+ voters
- ✅ Winners can claim their proportional share
- ✅ Losers get 0
- ✅ Contract balance depletes as winners claim
